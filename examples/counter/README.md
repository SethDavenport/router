# Counter Example

A simple example showing router setup along with `ng2-redux`. Stolen shamelessly from `ng2-redux`.

## Running this Example

There are two ways to run this example:

1. `npm start`: this will run the example against the published npm version of
`angular-redux/core` on port 8080. Use this if you just want to play around with the
example.
2. `npm run dev`: exactly the same as (1) except we link to the local `angular-redux/core`
source code in `../../`. Use this if you want to test modifications to `angular-redux/core`
itself.
